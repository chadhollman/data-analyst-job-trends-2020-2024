# Linear regression analysis
This branch contains the code needed (linear_regression_analysis.ipynb) to run a linear regression analysis of salary per year (USD) from 2020-2024 to answer the question 'What is in the future of data science jobs?'. We focused on data from the US at the entry, middle, senior and executive levels. In addition, we focused on the top 3 data science jobs in terms of highest counts or positions. 
This branch also contains a folder with the output plots.
